    "Note that Shan Ashley Lin is the other skater for China (together with Zhu Yi), but it may be hard to find her on the standings. You will find her if you click on CN next to Zhu Yi's listing. Also note that the top skaters from the Web site above may not really match with the real skaters competing, but that's ok.\n",
